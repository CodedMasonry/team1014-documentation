Not everything will be included here, but it gives a good starting point depending on what you're looking for.

## General Information

- [Terminology](/terms/)
  - Covers some vocabulary you might see, especially the ones we use often.
- [Competition](/competition/)
  - Goes over what is a regional, what is worlds, and how they work.
- [Scouting](/scouting/)
  - The importance of scouting, and the reasons we do it.
- [Awards](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/awards)
  - FRC has a lot of awards the team (and individuals) can win. If you want to read up on
    the awards, you can do so at the link. I won't go into depth about them,
    but I will keep the link here.
- [Impact / Outreach](/impact/)
  - What is Impact, and why we do it.
- [Why We Do This](/why/)
  - What is the point of robotics, and the team?
- [How To Contribute](/contribute/)
  - You don't have to know how to write code to make changes to the documentation.

## Groups

Groups are used vaguely here, but makes sorting documentation significantly easier.
Nobody is restricted to a group, with most of the people having a hand in a mix of all the groups. The purpose
of a group is just a collection of intended focus. For example, being with the "Mechanical Group" just
means you want to focus on building parts, rather then focusing on writing the code to make the parts work.

### Mechanical Group

The Mechanical Group is a catch-all for a focus on building a piece, part, or anything physical.
It's explained in further detail in the Intro to Mechanical.

- [Intro to Mechanical](/mechanical/intro/)
  - An explaination of what mechanical does, their goals, expectations, and their process.

### Programming Group

The Programming Group is a catch-all for anything writing code, or anything with computers. It's explained in
further detail in the Intro to Programming.

- [Intro to Programming](/programming/intro/)
  - An explaination of what programmers do, their goals, expectations, and their process.

### Electrical Group

We don't technically have an electrical group, but for sorting the documentation it is the easiest
way to do so. It should be noted eletrical **falls under the programming group** purely because of
it's importance for the programming group.

- [Intro to Electrical](/electrical/intro/)
  - An explaination of what electrical does, their goals, expectations, and their process.
