## Groups

It's intentionally vague, but makes managing people, and sorting documentation, significantly easier. Nobody is restricted to one group,
with most of the team having a hand in different groups. All the groups depend on each other. For example, **Programmers wait for
electrical to wire things, who wait for mechanical to build the the things**, and vice versa.

### Mechanical Group

Intro to Mechanical.

### Programming Group

The Programming Group is a catch-all for anyone writing code, or anything with computers. It's explained in
further detail in the Intro to Programming.
