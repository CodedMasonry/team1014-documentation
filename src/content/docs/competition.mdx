The game & the competitions overall stay relatively constant every year. This section
goes over how competition works, and some things you might want to know about it.

## How do competitions works?

In terms of competition, it is just an event where teams compete.

- We have **skirmishes**, which are
  non-ranked competitions where we would test our robot on an actual game field. These aren't a
  requirement to attend, but give the team opportunities to test the robot while it is still being worked on.
- We have **Regionals**, whish is where official competition happens.
- Finally, **Worlds**, is the main event. How the team makes it to worlds is explained in [What is Worlds?](#what-is-worlds)

## What is a Regional?

It's where the team formally competes against other teams. It's where placement for worlds is (often)
decided, and is where awards are given out. The team only goes to two regionals in a season (matter of cost).

## What is Worlds?

The entire point of regionals is to make it to worlds. It is the main event where the best teams compete. As of 2026,
there are basically three ways to make it to worlds. There are other ways, but you don't need to worry about those
at this moment.

- Being a finalist in a regional
- The Impact Award Finalist
- The Engineering Inspiration Award

  <summary>What does it mean to be a finalist?</summary>

If the team wins at a regional, they gain a seat at worlds to compete. This is
the traditional way of getting to worlds.

  <summary>What is the Imapct Award?</summary>

Without going into [immense
detail](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/awards), if your team can
demonstrate the incredible impact the team has on it's community, they get to
compete at worlds against other Impact award finalists. **It is the most
prestigious award in FRC**, and as such is incredibly difficult to gain.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the Engineering Inspiration Award?</summary>

Without going into [immense detail](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/awards), it focuses
inspiring people to join engineering. Quoting First directly, "Celebrates outstanding success
in advancing respect and appreciation for engineering within a teamâ€™s school or organization and community".

## Pre-competition

When we go to a competition, we need to load the robot and any parts / tools we may need to fix the robot,
along with anything else needed at competition (speak to the mentors if you want to know about the specifics).
Everything gets loaded into a truck, and the team rides seperately in a bus. Not much else to say here.

## Competition Layout

![A basic layout of the competition floor](/src/assets/images/basic-comp-layout.png)

This is a very basic layout, but is generally the universal one. Stands surround 3 sides of the field,
with pits behind it.

The team sits on the **stands** to watch the matches, scout the other team,
or if they aren't doing anything else and want a rest. It's recommended to put your stuff in the stands as
the pits don't have a lot of room.

The **field** is where matches happen. It's where robots do the robot things. It's where practice matches, qualifying,
and the actual eliminations happen.

### The Pit

So the pit is where teams set up tents to work on the robot. You are **required to have safety glasses** here,
so either bring your own, or borrow some from the team (please return them).

Each competition usually has a pit map on their website, which outlines where every team is in the pit. Everything
is organized so there is no guess work.

In the pit you will always find two stations, the `Pit Admin` desk, where you can ask for
information. The `Inspection` desk, which may or may not be near Pit Admin is where you go when it is time to get
the robot inspected

### Pit Admin

This is essentially the information desk for teams. You likely won't interact with them much beyond getting the schedule, and
getting the times of when you compete.

### Inspection

There are three seperate times when the robot **IS REQUIRED** to be inspected. This is to make sure your robot
won't you know...explode and what not.

- Before you can practice
- Before you can go to qualifying
- Before you can go to eliminations

## Competition Timeline

The schedule year over year stays pretty consistent, and follows a standard 3-Day span.

### Day 1 (On Arrival)

When the team first gets to the competition, `5 team members at most` head to a back entrance to unload the truck, and to set
up [the pit](#the-pit). The rest of the team goes through the main entrance, and finds seats in the stands.

### Day 1 (Practice)

The first day of competition is dedicated to practice. It allows for work to be done on the robot, and test functionality on the game field
and on the practice field. There are two forms of practice.

- **Practice Matches**
  - These only run on the first day. It follows the same style as [a match](#how-a-match-works). It allows drivers to get used
    to how the robot feels, and allows testing functionality on game field.
- **Practice Field**
  - The practice field allows the team to test the robot with the game pieces.

<Aside>
  The **practice field** is always opened, so utilise it as much as possible.
</Aside>

### Day 2 (Qualifying)

The second day is dedicated to qualifying matches. Each team plays in several
qualification matches, where they are **assigned** two team mates and three opponents.
At the end of each match, each **alliance\* wins a certain number of **rank points\*\* depending
on how well the alliance did during the match.

The average of how many rank points you have denotes your "place". Essentially, the
team with the highest average is first, second is the 2nd highest average, and so on. The goal
is to score as many rank points as possible.
