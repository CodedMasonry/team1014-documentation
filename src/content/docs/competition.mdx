## What is Worlds?

The entire point of regionals is to make it to worlds. It is the main event where the best teams compete. As of 2026,
there are basically three ways to make it to worlds. There are other ways, but you don't need to worry about those
at this moment.

- Being a finalist in a regional
- The Impact Award Finalist
- The Engineering Inspiration Award

Without going into [immense

demonstrate the incredible impact the team has on it's community, they get to
compete at worlds against other Impact award finalists. **It is the most
prestigious award in FRC**, and as such is incredibly difficult to gain.

  <summary>What is the Engineering Inspiration Award?</summary>

Without going into [immense detail](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/awards), it focuses
inspiring people to join engineering. Quoting First directly, "Celebrates outstanding success
