Going over how competition works, and some things you might want to know about it.

## How do competitions works?

In terms of competition, it is just an event where teams compete.

- We have **skirmishes**, which are
  non-ranked competitions where we would test our robot on an actual game field. These aren't a
  requirement to attend, but give the team opportunities to test the robot while it is still being worked on.
- We have **Regionals**, whish is where official competition happens.
- Finally, **Worlds**, is the main event. How the team makes it to worlds is explained in [What is Worlds?](#what-is-worlds)

## What is a Regional?

It's where the team formally competes against other teams. It's where placement for worlds is (often)
decided, and is where awards are given out. The team only goes to two regionals in a season (matter of cost).

## What is Worlds?

The entire point of regionals is to make it to worlds. It is the main event where the best teams compete. As of 2026,
there are basically three ways to make it to worlds. There are other ways, but you don't need to worry about those
at this moment.

- Being a finalist in a regional
- The Impact Award Finalist
- The Engineering Inspiration Award

If the team wins at a regional, they gain a seat at worlds to compete. This is
the traditional way of getting to worlds.

Without going into [immense
detail](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/awards), if your team can
demonstrate the incredible impact the team has on it's community, they get to
compete at worlds against other Impact award finalists. **It is the most
prestigious award in FRC**, and as such is incredibly difficult to gain.

  <summary>What is the Engineering Inspiration Award?</summary>

Without going into [immense detail](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/awards), it focuses
inspiring people to join engineering. Quoting First directly, "Celebrates outstanding success
in advancing respect and appreciation for engineering within a teamâ€™s school or organization and community".
