title: Welcome to Bad Robots 1014
description: An introduction to the team and the First Robotics Competition
---

This website is designed to document information and lessons that the team has learned in a centralized place.
If you're not from team 1014, you are still welcome to read what we have to share.

## What is Team 1014?

We are a First Robotics Competition (**FRC**) team ran through Dublin City Schools. High school students from the district
get the opportunity to join the robotics team to gain valuable, real world experience of working on a time-sensitive engineering program.
Without all the jargon, it's building a robot to do things (and maybe learn something doing it).

The number `1014` simply means we were the 1014th team to join the First Robotics Competition. The team was created in **2003**,
and subsequently named "Bad Robots" due to the robots not wanting to work properly, and has stuck over the decades.

## What is the First Robotics Competition?
