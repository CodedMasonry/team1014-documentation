title: Welcome to Bad Robots 1014
description: An introduction to the team and the First Robotics Competition
---

This website is designed to document information and lessons that the team has learned in a centralized place.
If you're not from team 1014, you are still welcome to read what we have to share.

## What is Team 1014?

We are a First Robotics Competition (**FRC**) team ran through Dublin City Schools. High school students from the district
get the opportunity to join the robotics team to gain valuable, real world experience of working on a time-sensitive engineering program.
Without all the jargon, it's building a robot to do things (and maybe learn something doing it).

The number `1014` simply means we were the 1014th team to join the First Robotics Competition. The team was created in **2003**,
and subsequently named "Bad Robots" due to the robots not wanting to work properly, and has stuck over the decades.

## What is the First Robotics Competition?

FRC is a program ran through [First Inspires](https://www.firstinspires.org/). They are an organization focused on, "...preparing
young people for the future". There's a lot of other marketing words and phrasing that all sum up to providing students an opportunity
to learn skills and gain experience.

The actual [First Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) starts in **January**, but **the team meets several
times before that** to get as many people up to speed as possible, and to do some initial planning (referred to as pre-season).

The specifics of each competition vary every year, **but follow very similar concepts**. Teams build a robot to perform specific tasks
in order to score points. In hopes of keeping this documentation relevant, I highly recommend checking out
[First Inspires](https://www.firstinspires.org/) website to learn what the game is during your season. If you want to really dive into
the specifics of the game, you can just look up **_frc game manual [YEAR]_** and will likely find a document outlining all
the...incredibly specific...details.

### The (rough) timeline

Teams are given roughly **1-2 months before** regional events start, and these events last roughly **6 weeks**. A robot doesn't need to be
finalized by week 1, but the goal is to a fully built robot by then so things can be tweaked and tuned before we go to a regional. On average,
our team only goes to two competitions in a season.

When it comes to meeting times, the mentors will send out a schedule for when the team meets. As of 2026, we use **GroupMe** and **Schoology**
to communicate this information, along with any other relevant information you might need. If you are not in either of these, please ask either
a mentor or another student on the team for a link to join / recieve an invitation to the groups.

  <summary>What is Pre-Season?</summary>
  Pre-Season refers to a few meetings that happen in the weeks prior to the
  actual competition starting. This is mainly dedicated to getting new members
  up to speed before we start building.

<details>
  <summary>What is Post Season?</summary>
  After week 6, assuming the team doesn't make it to worlds, we enter post
  season where the team does some planning, preparation, and generally trying to
  reduce the work we have to do once season starts.

## What else is there to know?

There is no specific order to how you should read the documentation, but I recommend checking out the [resources](/resources/) page
to get a short, but explicit description on how to find things. Think of it like a table of contents, but with descriptions.
