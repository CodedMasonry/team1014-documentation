title: Welcome to Bad Robots 1014
description: An introduction to the team and the First Robotics Competition
---

This website is designed to document information and lessons that the team has learned in a centralized place.
If you're not from Team 1014, you are still welcome to read what we have to share.

## What is Team 1014?

We are a First Robotics Competition (**FRC**) team run through Dublin City Schools. High school students from the district
get the opportunity to join the robotics team to gain valuable, real-world experience working on a time-sensitive engineering program.
Without all the jargon, it's building a robot to do things (and maybe learning something while doing it).

The number `1014` simply means we were the 1014th team to join the First Robotics Competition. The team was created in **2003**
and subsequently named "Bad Robots" due to the robots not wanting to work properly, and the name has stuck over the decades.

## What is the First Robotics Competition?

FRC is a program run through [First Inspires](https://www.firstinspires.org/). They are an organization focused on "...preparing
young people for the future." There are a lot of other marketing words and phrases that all sum up to providing students an opportunity
to learn skills and gain experience.

The actual [First Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) starts in **January**, but **the team meets several
times before that** to get as many people up to speed as possible and to do some initial planning (referred to as pre-season).

The specifics of each competition vary every year, **but follow very similar concepts**. Teams build a robot to perform specific tasks
in order to score points. In hopes of keeping this documentation relevant, I highly recommend checking out the
[First Inspires](https://www.firstinspires.org/) website to learn what the game is during your season. If you want to really dive into
the specifics of the game, you can just look up **_FRC game manual [YEAR]_** and will likely find a document outlining all
the...incredibly specific...details.

### The (rough) timeline

Teams are given roughly **1-2 months before** regional events start, and these events last roughly **6 weeks**. A robot doesn't need to be
finalized by week 1, but the goal is to have a fully built robot by then so things can be tweaked and tuned before we go to a regional. On average,
our team only goes to two competitions in a season.

When it comes to meeting times, the mentors will send out a schedule for when the team meets. As of 2026, we use **GroupMe** and **Schoology**
to communicate this information, along with any other relevant information you might need. If you are not in either of these, please ask either
a mentor or another student on the team for a link to join / receive an invitation to the groups.

  <summary>What is Pre-Season?</summary>
  Pre-Season refers to a few meetings that happen in the weeks prior to the
  actual competition starting. This is mainly dedicated to getting new members
  up to speed before we start building.

<details>
  <summary>What is Post-Season?</summary>
  After week 6, assuming the team doesn't make it to worlds, we enter post-
  season where the team does some planning, preparation, and generally tries to
  reduce the work we have to do once season starts.

## What else is there to know?

There is no specific order to how you should read the documentation, but I recommend checking out the [resources](/resources/) page
to get a short but explicit description on how to find things. Think of it like a table of contents, but with descriptions.
